> Glu is progressive delivery as code

Glu is a framework written and consumed in the Go programming language.
It is intended to glue together configuration repositories and artifact sources using `code`.

## Goals

The goals outlined here are defined to set a target for the project to work towards.
Glu has not yet reached all of these goals, but hopefully it gives an idea of our intended direction.
They're also not immutable and we would love your help in shaping them.

- Allow engineers to define application delivery across multiple environments as `code`.
- Create a central pane of glass for inspecting and interacting with promotion pipelines.
- Support defining complex rules to guard automated promotion using strategies such as smoke testing and performance evaluation.
- Simple and quick integration with common existing CI/CD and source control management platforms.
- Expose standardized telemetry for the entire end-to-end delivery of changes in your system.
